### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Maria.

I am a data engineer and software architect based in Stockholm, Sweden. 

What inspires me currently is the application of deep learning and developing smart solutions. I am also interested in company culture: how it works, what helps building it and what makes it deteriorate.

Open Source is another thing I feel passionate about, I'm an Apache Airflow contributor and I am excited to see what is waiting for me next.

- ðŸ’» &nbsp; Working as a Team Lead and data engineer at Flowbox.
- ðŸŒ± &nbsp; Currently learning ML, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, AWS data solutions.
- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp; Ask me about infrastructure as code on AWS, AWS CDK, CloudFormation, Airflow.
